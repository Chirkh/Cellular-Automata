# Cellular-Automata
This repository will contain some cellular automata simulations. All the simulatons in this repository use Python and Pygame.

## Conway's Game of Life ##

This program is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life, the rules for the game can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

The program begins with a random distribution of population.

This is an example of a random frame of the simulation.

## Langton's Ant ##

This program is a simulation of Langton's Ant, the rules of this game can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant

Here is an example of how the output looks after running on my machine (1.1Ghz Intel pentium processor and 4GB RAM) for around a minute:
